## The Inventory of the Solar System
   1. The Sun
      - Largest object in the solar system
      - About 99.9% of the total mass of the solar system is in the sun
      - The diameter of the sun is 109 times the diameter of the earth, or about 10 times the diameter of Jupiter
    2. 8 Planets moving in nearly circular orbits around the Sun and several dwarf planets

        - Dwarf Planets:
            - Pluto
            - Eris
        - The discovery of Eris in 2005 prompted the International Astronomical Union to come up with the following criteria for a body in the solar system to be classified as a planet:
            1. It has to revolve around the sun:
            2. It has to be massive enough to asssume approximately spherical shape under its own gravity
            3. It is the only body of that size at that distance from the sun (i.e. it has cleared its orbit)
        - Pluto fails criterion 3
    3. Satellites and rings
        - Shown in table above
    4. Asteroids
        - Appolo Asteroids
        - Trojan Asteroids
    5. Comets
        - Chunks of frozen gases with solid particles mixed in
        - Hale-Bopp 1997
    6. Meteors
        - Meteoroids:
            - Small Solid objects
        - Meteors
            - "Shooting Stars"
        - Meteorites
            - Finds on Earth
    7. Interplanetary Medium
        - Gas and dust

## Regularities in planetary motions:
1. First Kepler's Law
    - Planets move along elliptical orbits with Sun at one focus
    - Eccentricity is the measure of how elliptical the orbits are
    - The eccentricities of planetary orbits are less than 10 % (Except for mercury e = 0.206 ~= 21%)
   
    |Orbiting Body| Eccentricity|
    |:-:|:-:|
    |Mercury|e=0.206|
    |Venus|e=0.007|
    |Earth|e=0.017|
    |Mars|e=0.093|
    |Icarus|e=0.83|
    |Halley|e=0.968|
    
    - **Icarus** is an Apollo asteroid while **Halley** is a comet
2. The orbits of all planets are nearly in the plane of the ecliptic (the orbital plane of the earth)
    - the inclination angles of all planetary orbits are less than 10<sup>o</sup>
    - The solar system is **Flat**
3. All planets orbit the sun counter-clockwise (prograde motion) as one would observe from above the earth's north pole
    - The sun also spins counter-clockwise
4. Nearly all large satellites orbit their planets counter-clockwise
5. Nearly all planets spin counter-clockwise
    - Venus and Uranus excepted
    - The Obliquity of a planet is the axis tilt angle
        - Earth = 23<sup>o</sup>
        - Uranus = 90<sup>o</sup>
        - Venus = 177<sup>o</sup>
6. Nearly all large satellites have counter-clockwise spin
    - Except two satellites of mars (Phobos and Deimos); they are most likely captured asteroids
    - All satellites of uranus
7. Third Kepler's Law:
    - a<sup>3</sup>/p<sup>2</sup>=1
        - a = Average distance from the sun in AU
        - p = orbital period in year
    - The Law implies that the greater the distance from the sun(a), the longer is the orbital period(p)

- From 3-6 on can infer that there is a definite counter-clockwise twist in the solar system
## Some physical properties of planets:
- Diameter D
    - can be determined from agular size (A) and distance d
    - time of star occulation
- Mass M
    - From orbital data for one of its satellites using the third kepler's law as formulated by newton
- Density 
    - `Mass/Volume`
        - Volume from Diameter D

|Planet|Mass (in units of Earth Mass)| Density (in g/cm<sup>3</sup>|
|---------|:------------:|:--:|
|Mercury|0.055|5.43|
|Venus|0.815|5.24|
|Earth|1 (6*10<sup>24</sup>kg)|5.52|
|Mars|0.107|3.92|
|Jupiter|318|1.32|
|Saturn|95.1|0.70|
|Uranus|14.5|1.25|
|Neptune|17.2|1.76|
|(Sun)|(333 000)|(1.4)|

- Terrestrial planets- Small and dense
- Jovian planets- large and lower density

## Formation of the Solar System:
- Collapsing Nebula Scenario
    - Supposedly began 4.6 Billion Years ago in a wispy cloud of gas and dust
    - This cloud was a small part of a much bigger cloud
    - at some point, part of the cloud collapsed in on itself- possibly because the shockwabe of a nearby supernova explosion caused it to compress
    - the result: a flat spinning disk of dust and gas
    - Nuclear fusion occurs when hydrogen atoms fuse into helium
    - when enough material collected at this disk's center, nuclear fusion began. Our sun was born.
    - The sun gobbled up 99.8% of all the material
    - The material left behing by the sun clumped together into bigger and bigger peices
    - These clumps became planets, dwarf planets, asteroids, comets, and moons.
    - Only rocky things could survive close to the sun, so gaseous and icy material collected further away.
    - Comets and asteroids are left over remains of the solar system's formation.
- Frost line
    - inside the frost line: temperature > -120<sup>o</sup>c
    - outside the frost line: temperature < -120<sup>o</sup>c
- Condensation temperature is the temperature at which a substance solidifies. 
    - It increases with pressure.
    - In space pressure is 0
- Condensation Sequence

    |Material| Relative Abundance| Condensation Temperature|
    |-|:-:|:-:|
    |Iron, Nickel, Aluminium|0.2%|1000-1600K|
    |Various Minerals|0.4%|500-1300K|
    |Water, Methane, Ammonia|1.4%|<150k = -120<sup>o</sup>c|
    |Hydrogen, Helium|98%|DO NOT Condense at 0 pressure|

    - Hence, terrestrial planets are composed of rocks and metals and have high density; jovian planets are composed mostly of hydrogen and helium and have low density.
    - Small solid particles collided, occasionally sticking to one another forming larger grains (**Accretion process)
    - Larger bodies (**Planetesimals) ranging in size from 1 km to 100 km were formed through accretion process (analogy: a rolling snowball)
    - Planetesimals swept most of the dust and small particles
    - Once the larger planetesimals grew to the point that their gravity was significant they grew ralidly into **Protoplanets**.
    - The powerful solar wind from the young sun(T-Tauri Phase) cleared out dust and gas still dispersed between the planets.
    - The entire process of formation of the solar system may have lasted a few hundred million years and was completed 4.6 billion years ago.

## How old is the Solar System?
- **Radiometric Dating**:
    - Method of rock dating
    - Compare the relative amounts of Parent atom and daughter atom and deduce the age of the rock from the known half-life of the parent atom.
    - Example:

        | Parent| Daughter| Half-Life|
        |:-----:|:-------:|:--------:|
        |<sup>14</sup>C|<sup>14</sup>N|5730 Y|
        |<sup>40</sup>K|<sup>40</sup>Ar|1.248 Billion Y|
        |<sup>238</sup>U|<sup>206</sup>Pb|4.47 Billion Y|
        |<sup>232</sup>Th|<sup>206</sup>Pb|14.0 Billion Y|

    - Earth: 
        - Most old rocks are 2.5 - 3.8 billion years old
        - Earth's oldest known rocks are in Canada and are 4.031 +- 0.003 billion years old
        - Isolated crystals (but no complete rocks) as old as 4.4 billion years have been found in australian Shield
        - Conclusion:
            - The age of the Earth is at least 4.4 billion years
    - Moon: 
        - 3.16 billion y(lunar maria)-4.5 billion y(highlands)
    - Meteorites:
        - 4.55 Billion years
    - Sun:
        - Theoretical calculations of the probable age based on its mass and luminosity give 4.6 billion years
    - Conclusion:
        - the Solar system formed about 4.6 billion years ago
    - After the planets were formed further evolution involves
        - Intense bombardment by leftover debris
            - Evidence: impact craters on Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars and on nearly all planetary satellites
            - Impact craters have a central peak from the shockwave
            - The floors of impact craters are lower than the surrounding surface.

## Melting of the interior and volcanism
- The heat generated by radioactive decay processes of <sup>40</sup>K, <sup>238</sup>U, <sup>232</sup>Th melted the interior of terrestrial planets
- Consequences of molten core:
    - Differentiation:
        - The heavy molten metals (iron, nickel) sink and light siligate rocks float to the surface.
        - Inner core: solid
        - Outer core: liquid
        - Mantle: solid
- Probing the earth's interior using the seismic waves:
    - P(pressure)-waves propagate through both solid and liquid
    - S(shear)-waves can propogate only through solid
    - inner core: radius = 1,200 km
    - outer core: radius = 3,500 km
- Plate tectonics (continental drift):
    - The top rock layer is solid and it moves in large plates
    - first proposed by alfred wegener in 1912, but was ignored until 1960s
        - break up of pangea: 200 million years to present
    - Active volcanoes exist more commonly along the boundary of two plates
    - a lot of volcanoes along pacific plate. `Ring of Fire`
    - The floors of volcanic craters are higher than the surrounding surface.
    - Mars has an enourmous dead volcano (Olympus Mons)
    - Small bodies (moon, mercury, mars) cooled quickly and might have a small molten core.
    - Venus has more volcanoes than any other planer- over 1600 major volcanoes

## Planetary Atmospheres
- Source:
    1. The original gas in the cold cloud of interstellar material (74% H, 24% He) **Primary Atmosphere**
    2. Volcanic gases:
        - Carbon Dioxide
        - Sulfur Dioxide
        - Water vapor
        - Nitrogen
- Only the Jovian planets still have the primary atmosphere
    - The high clouds on jupiter are composed of ammonia crystals
- Terrestrial planets have lost the primary atmosphere
    - A planet can lose its atmosphere if 
        1. it has a hot surface
        2. it is small so that the escape velocity from it is low
            - The molecules of the atmosphere move in a choatic way with some average speed V which is related to the temperature T by T=1/3 m*V<sup>2</sup> where m is the mass of a molecule
            - The escape velocity V<sub>esc</sub> from a planet is determined by its mass M and radius R: 
                - V<sub>esc</sub><sup>2</sup> = 2*G*M/R 
                    - G: Gravitational Constant
            - High T implies high V, in particular if m is small (e.g. hydrogen and helium) and small M implies a small V<sub>esc</sub> if V>V<sub>esc</sub>
- which factors determine the surface temperature T?
    1. The distance from the Sun.
    2. How much of the received solar energy is reflected back (**reflectivity** or **albedo**)
        - albedo/reflectivity = percentage of incoming light that is reflected back
        - pure rocky surface: low albedo (the surface obsorbs most of the solar energy)
        - some clouds: high albedo
        
        |Planet|Albedo|
        |:----:|:----:|
        |Mercury|11%|
        |Venus|72%|
        |Earth|36%|
        |(Moon)|(7%)|
        |Mars|25%|
        |Jupiter|34%|
        |Saturn|34%|
        |Uranus|34%|
        |Neptune|29%|
    
    - Mercury
        - High surface temperature
            - close to the sun
            - low reflectivity
            - small planet => low gravity/ escape velocity
            - Mercury's atmosphere is extremely thins (the pressure is less than 10<sup>-12</sup>)
    - Venus
        - Venus has a substantial atmosphere
        - Composition: CO<sub>2</sub>(96%), N<sub>2</sub>(3.5%) small amounts of SO<sub>2</sub>, H<sub>2</sub>O, Sulfuric Acid, Hydrochloric acid
        - Surface temperature =  462<sup>o</sup>C
        - Surface pressure: 92 atm
        - Clouds: droplets of sulfuric acid
        - Why is venus so hot?
            - It is caused by a runwaway **Greenhouse Effect**
            - The Molecules of H<sub>2</sub>O, CH<sub>4</sub>, and CO<sub>2</sub> (the greenhouse gases)trap the infrared radiation and the atmosphere heats up.
        - Why is the atmosphere of earth so different from the atmosphere of venus?
            - our distance from the sun is just right so that our H<sub>2</sub>O is mainly liquid waterm (the temperature is between 0<sup>o</sup>c and 100<sup>o</sup>c)
            - liquid water absorbs CO<sub>2</sub> from the atmosphere producing carbonic acid
            - Carbonic acid + rock ==> limestone
            - As a result, mainly Nitrogen (N<sub>2</sub>) was left.
            - Oxygen was formed by uv radiation hitting 2H<sub>2</sub>O splitting it into O<sub>2</sub> and 2H<sub>2</sub> which escaped
            - Up until 2-2.5 billion years ago this was the only source of oxygen in the earth's atmosphere.
            - By that time the **Cyanobacteria (blue-green algae) evolved. they consoume CO<sub>2</sub> and H<sub>2</sub>O and through the process of photosynthesis produce carbohydrate molecules (e.g sugars) and release O<sub>2</sub>. As a result the oxygen conent in Earth's atmosphere increased more rapidly.
            - Percent Composition:
                - N<sub>2</sub>: 78%
                - O<sub>2</sub>: 21%
                - H<sub>2</sub>O Ar CO<sub>2</sub>: less than 1%
                - N<sub>2</sub> and O<subsup>2</sub> are not greenhouse gases
    - Mars:
        - Mars has a very thin atmosphere
            - Pressure: 0.005 atm
            - Temperature: -140<sup>o</sup>c +- 20<sup>o</sup>c
            - Percent Composition:
                - CO<sub>2</sub>: 95%
                - N<sub>2</sub>: 2.7%
                - Ar: 1.6%
                - CO: 0.6%
                - O<sub>2</sub>: 0.15%
                - H<sub>2</sub>O: 0.03%
            - Mars has no magnetic field to shield it from the solar wind which eroded its atmosphere
    - The Jovian planets are large enough and far enough from the sun (beyond the frostline) that they were able to retain the primary atmosphere (hydrogen and helium)
    - Jupiter's atmosphere: 
        - H<sub>2</sub>: 90%
        - He: 10%
        - Ne: < 1%
        - NH<sub>3</sub>
        - Ar
        - Methane
    
    - Saturn's Atmosphere:
        - H<sub>2</sub>: 88%
        - He: 11%
        - Ne: 1%
        - Ammonia
        - Methane
    - Uranus' Atmosphere
        - H<sub>2</sub>: 76%
        - He: 23%
        - Methane (gives a blue color)
    - Neptune: 
        - Mostly H<sub>2</sub> and the rest is He with some methane (blue color)
        
## Tidal forces, Satellites and Rings  
- The real objects are not absolutely rigind and the deform if the applied force is sufficently strong
- Tidal forces are lethal on the event horizon
- F<sub>gravity</sub> proportional to 1/distance<sup>2</sup>
- Gravitational pull on the legs is greater than the gravitational pull on the head and there is a net stretching force, so called **Tidal Force**
- Tidal force on the earth exerted by the moon = F<sub>N</sub>-F<sub>F</sub> proportional to the M<sub>moon</sub>
- Hence a more massive body exerts a bigger tidal force- the moon is stretched more by the earth than the other way around
- Consequences:
    1. Tides on earth
        - Near side: water is pulled away from the earth toward the moon
        - far side: Earth is pulled away from water toward the moon
        - Net result: two tidal bulges
        - The bulges follow the moon which revolves around the earth once a month. The earth spins once a day. Hence there are about two high tides and two low tides at each point on earth during a 24 hour period. THe moon moves by about 360<sup>o</sup>/30 days= 12<sup>0</sup>/day and the interval between successive high tides is not 12 hours but 12 hours and 25 minutes
    2. Slowing down of earth's rotation and recession of the moon
        - Because the earth is rotating, the earth's tidal bulge is a few degrees off from lining up with the moon.
        - The land masses exert force on water as the earth rotates causing the water bulge to overshoot
        - The moon in turn tries to align the bulge pulling it back. This is transfered to the lnad masses, causing a slow decrease in the earth's rotation rate, i.e. the longer days. The day increases by about 0.002 seconds per century.
        - The bulge, in turn, exerts a force on the moon tha has a component along moon's orbit, it increases the moon's orbital speed causing it to go into a higher orbit. The moon is drifting away at a rate of 3.8 cm per year
        - when the earth- moon system formed 4.5 billion years ago the moon was a lot closer (22,500 km) than it is now (384400 km). also the day on earth was a lot shorter ( 5 hours) than now (24 hours)
    3. Moons synchronous rotation
        - The moon is in synchronous rotation
        - This means that the time it takes to orbit the earth is the same as the time it takes to rotate once 
        - i.e. the same side of the moon faces the earth
    4. Volcanism on Io
        - Io's orbit is elliptical and the tidal stretching varies in a periodic way- it is largest at periapsis and smallest at apoapsis. This perpetual flexing leads to the heating of Io's interior- tidal heating
- Planetary rings
    - Jupiter:
        - Ring discovered in 1979 by voyager 1.
        - it consists of very fine dust particles
    - Saturn 
        - has spectacular rings first observed by galileo
        - The rings consist of chunks of ice or rocks covered with ice; they have a very high albedo
        - The chunks range in size from a ping pon ball to a house
        - They  stretch 274,00km from tip to tip but they are less than 100 meters thick;
        - the rings are divided by gaps; the bigges is called **Cassini division**. This division is causes by saturn's satellite mimas:
        - The resonant gravitational pull takes the object out of the gap
    - Uranus
        - The ring discovered in 1977 by occultation; since then 9 very thin rings were discovered by voyager 2. they are made of dark material with very low albedo
    - Neptune:
        - First discovered in 1984 and in 1989 voyager 2 found thin nonuniform rings
    - Why do rings form and not another satellite
        - The tidal force increases as the distance between the satellite and the planet decreases because the force of gravity varies as 1/distance<sup>2</sup>
    - Roche Limit:
        - The critical distance inside which the tidal force on a satellite is sufficient to disrupt it
        - the difference in speeds causes the brocken up material form a ring
        - for a satellite held together by its own gravity the roche limit is approximately **2.4 times the radius of the bplanet**
