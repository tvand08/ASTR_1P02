# Chapter 9: Stellar Remnants

## Remnants of a Medium Mass Star
- __Planetary Nebula:__ spherical shell of the star's material pushed out by the thermal and radiation pressure during the final red giant stage.
- White dwarf in center of __Planetary Nebula__ is "dead"(non fusing) core composed of <sup>12</sup>C and some <sup>16</sup>O.
- Examples of planetary nebulae:
  - Helix nebula
  - Ring nebula
- Seen as a ring instead of spherical shell.
- Their name (planetary) comes from the fact that when viewed through a small telescope they appear as blue-green, just like the planets uranus and neptune.
- But they have nothing to do with planets or planet formation
