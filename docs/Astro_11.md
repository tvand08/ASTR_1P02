# Chapter 11: Galaxies

## Classification of Galaxies

- Based on their appearance at visual wavelenghts:

### Elliptical Galaxies (E)

- Contain no visible gas and dust and lack hot bright stars.
- They contain mostly Population II stars and tend to be red.
- Deviation from the perfect sphere is characterized by the number.
- E0, E1, E2,..., E7
- E0 = more spherical shape | E7 = Highly Elliptical Shape
- The masses of Elliptical galaxies vary from 10% of the mass of the milky way to 100 times the mass of the milky way

### Spiral Galaxies (S)

- S<sub>0</sub> (lenticular) galaxies:
  - They have a very large nucleus and hardly visible spiral arms
- S<sub>a</sub> Galaxies:
  - These galaxies have large nuclei, less gas and dust and fewer hot luminous young stars compared to S<sub>b</sub> and S<sub>c</sub>
- S<sub>c</sub> Galaxies:
  - These galaxies have small nuclei, lots of gas and dust concentrated in spiral arms and many hot, luminous young stars located in spiral arms.
  - Appear blue in color.
- S<sub>b</sub> Galaxies:
  - Between S<sub>a</sub> according to the size of the nucleus, amount of gas and dust, and the number of hot bright stars.
  - 2/3 of spiral galaxies are so called barred spiral galaxies (SB)
  - They are divided into SBa, SBb and SBc according to the same criteria used for ordinary spirals.
