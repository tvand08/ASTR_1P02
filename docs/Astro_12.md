# Chapter 12: Cosmology

## Introduction

- The universe has a finite age
- Obler's Paradox(1826): If the universe existed for ever, is infinite, and is uniformly filled with stars then the night sky should not be dark.
- Plausible Resolution (Edgar Allan Pe, 1849):
  - The Universe is not infinitely old and the light from distant stars didn't have time to reach us yet.

## Big Bang Theory

- The universe was created in a giant explostion and has been expanding ever since.
- The Hubble's law is consitent with this scenario
- Hubble's time = Supposed Age of the universe = 13.7 billion years
- What is the evidence for the Big Bang?
  - Right after the explosion the universe had to be very hot and dense, but it cooled as it expanded.
  - When the temperature dropped to about 3000 k (380,000 years after the big bang), it was possible for protos to capture electrons and form neutral hydrogen atoms.
- The universe became transparent to light. The radiation was in equilibrium with matter at 3,000 k and thus satisfied the Wien's law (black body radiation law):
- Since then the universe expanded in size 1000 times and the cosomological redshift increase to a wavelength in microwave range and the corresponding temperature is about 3000k/1000 = 3k.
- This relic radidation, so called **microwave background radiation**, should be observable in all directions, day and night.
- It was first observed in 1964 by **Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson** of **Bell Labs**.
- Since then, several satellite missions were performed to examine the details of the microwave radiation background radiation
  - `COBE`
  - `WMAP`
  - `Planck`

## Fate of the universe

- The answer depends on the density of matter/energy in the universe characterized by the parameter `Ω`
- `Ω` = Density/Critical density
- `Ω > 1`: Recollapsing universe
  - It ends in **The Big Crunch**
  - The universe has a positive curvature
- `Ω < 1:`: Coasting universe
  - Keeps on expanding at a constant rate
  - Has a negative curvature
- `Ω = 1`: Critical universe
  - Keeps on expanding but the expansion rate will reduce to zero in infinite future
  - Has zero curvature
- Observation (1998):
  - 4-5 billion years ago the expansion rate of the universe started to increase
  - The expansion of the universe accelerated
  - Explained with the comsological constant Λ

## Cosmolical Constant Λ

- Introduced to prevent the universe from collapsoing under its own gravity.
- Gravity decreases with distance
- Λ is a property of spacetime that acts over all distances
- 4-5 billion years ago, when the seperation between the galaxies became large enough, Λ started to dominate over gravitational attraction and the expansion started to accelerate.
- What is the physical origin of Λ?
  - Unknown
  - We call it **Dark energy**
  - It has to have a positive energy density but negative pressure

## Total Ω

- The total Ω of the universe is 
  - Ω = Ω<sub>M</sub> + Ω<sub>Λ</sub> = 1
  - Ω<sub>M</sub>: Contribution from ordinary matter and dark matter ~ 1
  - Ω<sub>Λ</sub>: Contribution from dark energy ~ 0.7
- Hence, the universe is flat and currenly expanding at an accelerated rate.
