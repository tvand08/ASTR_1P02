# Chapter 12: Cosmology

## Introduction

- The universe has a finite age
- Obler's Paradox(1826): If the universe existed for ever, is infinite, and is uniformly filled with stars then the night sky should not be dark.
- Plausible Resolution (Edgar Allan Pe, 1849):
  - The Universe is not infinitely old and the light from distant stars didn't have time to reach us yet.

## Big Bang Theory

- The universe was created in a giant explostion and has been expanding ever since.
- The Hubble's law is consitent with this scenario
- Hubble's time = Supposed Age of the universe = 13.7 billion years
- What is the evidence for the Big Bang?
  - Right after the explosion the universe had to be very hot and dense, but it cooled as it expanded.
  - When the temperature dropped to about 3000 k (380,000 years after the big bang), it was possible for protos to capture electrons and form neutral hydrogen atoms.
- The universe became transparent to light. The radiation was in equilibrium with matter at 3,000 k and thus satisfied the Wien's law (black body radiation law):
- Since then the universe expanded in size 1000 times and the cosomological redshift increase to a wavelength in microwave range and the corresponding temperature is about 3000k/1000 = 3k.
- This relic radidation, so called **microwave background radiation**, should be observable in all directions, day and night.
- It was first observed in 1964 by **Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson** of **Bell Labs**.
- Since then, several satellite missions were performed to examine the details of the microwave radiation background radiation
  - `COBE`
  - `WMAP`
  - `Planck`

## Fate of the universe

- The answer depends on the density of matter/energy in the universe characterized by the parameter 'omega'
- Omega = Density/Critical density'
