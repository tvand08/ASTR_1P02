# Chapter 13: Solar System

## The Inventory of the Solar System
   1. The Sun
      - Largest object in the solar system
      - About 99.9% of the total mass of the solar system is in the sun
      - The diameter of the sun is 109 times the diameter of the earth, or about 10 times the diameter of Jupiter
    2. 8 Planets moving in nearly circular orbits around the Sun and several dwarf planets

        | Planet  | Type        | Distance from Sun| Known Satellites | Rings |
        |---------|:-----------:|:----------------:|:----------------:|:-----:|
        | Mercury | Terrestrial | 0.4 AU           | None             | NO    |
        | Venus   | Terrestrial | 0.7 AU           | None             | NO    |  
        | Earth   | Terrestrial | 1 AU             | 1 ( The Moon)    | NO    | 
        | Mars    |Terrestrial  | 1.5 AU           | 2                | NO    |
        | Jupiter | Jovian      | 5 AU             | 63+              | YES   |
        | Saturn  | Jovian      | 10 AU            | 61+              | YES   |
        | Uranus  | Jovian      | 20 AU            | 27+              | YES   |
        | Neptune | Jovian      | 30 AU            | 13+              | YES   |

        - Dwarf Planets:
            - Pluto
            - Eris
        - The discovery of Eris in 2005 prompted the International Astronomical Union to come up with the following criteria for a body in the solar system to be classified as a planet:
            1. It has to revolve around the sun:
            2. It has to be massive enough to asssume approximately spherical shape under its own gravity
            3. It is the only body of that size at that distance from the sun (i.e. it has cleared its orbit)
        - Pluto fails criterion 3
    3. Satellites and rings
        - Shown in table above
    4. Asteroids
        - Appolo Asteroids
        - Trojan Asteroids
    5. Comets
        - Chunks of frozen gases with solid particles mixed in
        - Hale-Bopp 1997
    6. Meteors
        - Meteoroids:
            - Small Solid objects
        - Meteors
            - "Shooting Stars"
        - Meteorites
            - Finds on Earth
    7. Interplanetary Medium
        - Gas and dust

## Regularities in planetary motions:
1. First Kepler's Law
    - Planets move along elliptical orbits with Sun at one focus
    - Eccentricity is the measure of how elliptical the orbits are
    - The eccentricities of planetary orbits are less than 10 % (Except for mercury e = 0.206 ~= 21%)
   
    |Orbiting Body| Eccentricity|
    |:-:|:-:|
    |Mercury|e=0.206|
    |Venus|e=0.007|
    |Earth|e=0.017|
    |Mars|e=0.093|
    |Icarus|e=0.83|
    |Halley|e=0.968|
    
    - **Icarus** is an Apollo asteroid while **Halley** is a comet
2. The orbits of all planets are nearly in the plane of the ecliptic (the orbital plane of the earth)
    - the inclination angles of all planetary orbits are less than 10<sup>o</sup>
    - The solar system is **Flat**
3. All planets orbit the sun counter-clockwise (prograde motion) as one would observe from above the earth's north pole
    - The sun also spins counter-clockwise
4. Nearly all large satellites orbit their planets counter-clockwise
5. Nearly all planets spin counter-clockwise
    - Venus and Uranus excepted
    - The Obliquity of a planet is the axis tilt angle
        - Earth = 23<sup>o</sup>
        - Uranus = 90<sup>o</sup>
        - Venus = 177<sup>o</sup>
6. Nearly all large satellites have counter-clockwise spin
    - Except two satellites of mars (Phobos and Deimos); they are most likely captured asteroids
    - All satellites of uranus

- From 3-6 on can infer that there is a definite counter-clockwise twist in the solar system

7. Third Kepler's Law:
    - a<sup>3</sup>/p<sup>2</sup>=1
        - a = Average distance from the sun in AU
        - p = orbital period in year
    - The Law implies that the greater the distance from the sun(a), the longer is the orbital period(p)

## Some physical properties of planets:
- Diameter D
    - can be determined from agular size (A) and distance d
    - time of star occulation
- Mass M
    - From orbital data for one of its satellites using the third kepler's law as formulated by newton
- Density 
    - `Mass/Volume`
        - Volume from Diameter D
|Planet|Mass (in units of Earth Mass)| Density (in g/cm<sup>3</sup>|
|---------|:------------:|:--:|
|Mercury|0.055|5.43|
|Venus|0.815|5.24|
|Earth|1(6*10<sup>24</sup>kg|5.52|
