## The Inventory of the Solar System
   1. The Sun
      - Largest object in the solar system
      - About 99.9% of the total mass of the solar system is in the sun
      - The diameter of the sun is 109 times the diameter of the earth, or about 10 times the diameter of Jupiter
    2. 8 Planets moving in nearly circular orbits around the Sun and several dwarf planets

        | Planet  | Type        | Distance from Sun| Known Satellites | Rings |

        - Dwarf Planets:
            - Pluto
            - Eris
        - The discovery of Eris in 2005 prompted the International Astronomical Union to come up with the following criteria for a body in the solar system to be classified as a planet:
            1. It has to revolve around the sun:
            2. It has to be massive enough to asssume approximately spherical shape under its own gravity
            3. It is the only body of that size at that distance from the sun (i.e. it has cleared its orbit)
        - Pluto fails criterion 3
    3. Satellites and rings
        - Shown in table above
    4. Asteroids
        - Appolo Asteroids
        - Trojan Asteroids
    5. Comets
        - Chunks of frozen gases with solid particles mixed in
        - Hale-Bopp 1997
    6. Meteors
        - Meteoroids:
            - Small Solid objects
        - Meteors
            - "Shooting Stars"
        - Meteorites
            - Finds on Earth
    7. Interplanetary Medium
        - Gas and dust

## Regularities in planetary motions:
1. First Kepler's Law
    - Planets move along elliptical orbits with Sun at one focus
    - Eccentricity is the measure of how elliptical the orbits are
    - The eccentricities of planetary orbits are less than 10 % (Except for mercury e = 0.206 ~= 21%)
   
    |Orbiting Body| Eccentricity|
    |:-:|:-:|
    |Mercury|e=0.206|
    |Venus|e=0.007|
    |Earth|e=0.017|
    |Mars|e=0.093|
    |Icarus|e=0.83|
    |Halley|e=0.968|
    
    - **Icarus** is an Apollo asteroid while **Halley** is a comet
2. The orbits of all planets are nearly in the plane of the ecliptic (the orbital plane of the earth)
    - the inclination angles of all planetary orbits are less than 10<sup>o</sup>
    - The solar system is **Flat**
3. All planets orbit the sun counter-clockwise (prograde motion) as one would observe from above the earth's north pole
    - The sun also spins counter-clockwise
4. Nearly all large satellites orbit their planets counter-clockwise
5. Nearly all planets spin counter-clockwise
    - Venus and Uranus excepted
    - The Obliquity of a planet is the axis tilt angle
        - Earth = 23<sup>o</sup>
        - Uranus = 90<sup>o</sup>
        - Venus = 177<sup>o</sup>
6. Nearly all large satellites have counter-clockwise spin
    - Except two satellites of mars (Phobos and Deimos); they are most likely captured asteroids
    - All satellites of uranus
7. Third Kepler's Law:
    - a<sup>3</sup>/p<sup>2</sup>=1
        - a = Average distance from the sun in AU
        - p = orbital period in year
    - The Law implies that the greater the distance from the sun(a), the longer is the orbital period(p)

- From 3-6 on can infer that there is a definite counter-clockwise twist in the solar system
## Some physical properties of planets:
- Diameter D
    - can be determined from agular size (A) and distance d
    - time of star occulation
- Mass M
    - From orbital data for one of its satellites using the third kepler's law as formulated by newton
- Density 
    - `Mass/Volume`
        - Volume from Diameter D

|Planet|Mass (in units of Earth Mass)| Density (in g/cm<sup>3</sup>|
|---------|:------------:|:--:|
|Mercury|0.055|5.43|
|Venus|0.815|5.24|
|Earth|1 (6*10<sup>24</sup>kg)|5.52|
|Mars|0.107|3.92|
|Jupiter|318|1.32|
|Saturn|95.1|0.70|
|Uranus|14.5|1.25|
|Neptune|17.2|1.76|
|(Sun)|(333 000)|(1.4)|

- Terrestrial planets- Small and dense
- Jovian planets- large and lower density

## Formation of the Solar System:
- Collapsing Nebula Scenario
    - Supposedly began 4.6 Billion Years ago in a wispy cloud of gas and dust
    - This cloud was a small part of a much bigger cloud
    - at some point, part of the cloud collapsed in on itself- possibly because the shockwabe of a nearby supernova explosion caused it to compress
    - the result: a flat spinning disk of dust and gas
    - Nuclear fusion occurs when hydrogen atoms fuse into helium
    - when enough material collected at this disk's center, nuclear fusion began. Our sun was born.
    - The sun gobbled up 99.8% of all the material
    - The material left behing by the sun clumped together into bigger and bigger peices
    - These clumps became planets, dwarf planets, asteroids, comets, and moons.
    - Only rocky things could survive close to the sun, so gaseous and icy material collected further away.
    - Comets and asteroids are left over remains of the solar system's formation.
- Frost line
    - inside the frost line: temperature > -120<sup>o</sup>c
    - outside the frost line: temperature < -120<sup>o</sup>c
- Condensation temperature is the temperature at which a substance solidifies. 
    - It increases with pressure.
    - In space pressure is 0
- Condensation Sequence

    |Material| Relative Abundance| Condensation Temperature|
    |-|:-:|:-:|
    |Iron, Nickel, Aluminium|0.2%|1000-1600K|
    |Various Minerals|0.4%|500-1300K|
    |Water, Methane, Ammonia|1.4%|<150k = -120<sup>o</sup>c|
    |Hydrogen, Helium|98%|DO NOT Condense at 0 pressure|

    - Hence, terrestrial planets are composed of rocks and metals and have high density; jovian planets are composed mostly of hydrogen and helium and have low density.
    - Small solid particles collided, occasionally sticking to one another forming larger grains (**Accretion process)
    - Larger bodies (**Planetesimals) ranging in size from 1 km to 100 km were formed through accretion process (analogy: a rolling snowball)
    - Planetesimals swept most of the dust and small particles
    - Once the larger planetesimals grew to the point that their gravity was significant they grew ralidly into **Protoplanets**.
    - The powerful solar wind from the young sun(T-Tauri Phase) cleared out dust and gas still dispersed between the planets.
    - The entire process of formation of the solar system may have lasted a few hundred million years and was completed 4.6 billion years ago.

## How old is the Solar System?
- **Radiometric Dating**:
    - Method of rock dating
    - Compare the relative amounts of Parent atom and daughter atom and deduce the age of the rock from the known half-life of the parent atom.
    - Example:

        | Parent| Daughter| Half-Life|
        |:-----:|:-------:|:--------:|
        |<sup>14</sup>C|<sup>14</sup>N|5730 Y|
        |<sup>40</sup>K|<sup>40</sup>Ar|1.248 Billion Y|
        |<sup>238</sup>U|<sup>206</sup>Pb|4.47 Billion Y|
        |<sup>232</sup>Th|<sup>206</sup>Pb|14.0 Billion Y|

    - Earth: 
        - Most old rocks are 2.5 - 3.8 billion years old
        - Earth's oldest known rocks are in Canada and are 4.031 +- 0.003 billion years old
        - Isolated crystals (but no complete rocks) as old as 4.4 billion years have been found in australian Shield
        - Conclusion:
            - The age of the Earth is at least 4.4 billion years
    - Moon: 
        - 3.16 billion y(lunar maria)-4.5 billion y(highlands)
    - Meteorites:
        - 4.55 Billion years
    - Sun:
        - Theoretical calculations of the probable age based on its mass and luminosity give 4.6 billion years
    - Conclusion:
        - the Solar system formed about 4.6 billion years ago
    - After the planets were formed further evolution involves
        - Intense bombardment by leftover debris
            - Evidence: impact craters on Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars and on nearly all planetary satellites
            - Impact craters have a central peak from the shockwave
            - The floors of impact craters are lower than the surrounding surface.

## Melting of the interior and volcanism
- The heat generated by radioactive decay processes of <sup>40</sup>K, <sup>238</sup>U, <sup>232</sup>Th melted the interior of terrestrial planets
- Consequences of molten core:
    - Differentiation:
        - The heavy molten metals (iron, nickel) sink and light siligate rocks float to the surface.
        - Inner core: solid
        - Outer core: liquid
        - Mantle: solid
- Probing the earth's interior using the seismic waves:
    - P(pressure)-waves propagate through both solid and liquid
    - S(shear)-waves can propogate only through solid
    - inner core: radius = 1,200 km
    - outer core: radius = 3,500 km
- Plate tectonics (continental drift):
    - The top rock layer is solid and it moves in large plates
    - first proposed by alfred wegener in 1912, but was ignored until 1960s
        - break up of pangea: 200 million years to present
    - Active volcanoes exist more commonly along the boundary of two plates
    - a lot of volcanoes along pacific plate. `Ring of Fire`
    - The floors of volcanic craters are higher than the surrounding surface.
    - Mars has an enourmous dead volcano (Olympus Mons)
    - Small bodies (moon, mercury, mars) cooled quickly and might have a small molten core.
    - Venus has more volcanoes than any other planer- over 1600 major volcanoes
