# Chapter 9: Stellar Remnants

## Remnants of a Medium Mass Star
- __Planetary Nebula:__ spherical shell of the star's material pushed out by the thermal and radiation pressure during the final red giant stage.
- White dwarf in center of __Planetary Nebula__ is "dead"(non fusing) core composed of <sup>12</sup>C and some <sup>16</sup>O.
- Examples of planetary nebulae:
  - Helix nebula
  - Ring nebula
- Seen as a ring instead of spherical shell.
- Their name (planetary) comes from the fact that when viewed through a small telescope they appear as blue-green, just like the planets uranus and neptune.
- But they have nothing to do with planets or planet formation
### White dwarfs
- Examples of white dwarfs:
  - Sirus b
- White dwarfs are very dense:
  - Density= 1000kg/m<sup>3</sup>
- Why doesn't it collapse under it's own gravity (it stopped generating energy via fusion)?
- It is supported by __Electron Degeneracy Pressure:__
  - Positively charged <sup>12</sup>C and some <sup>16</sup>O nuclei densly packed
  - Negative electrions which are in __Degenerate State__
- Quantam Mechangics: Electrons obey __Pauli Principle__- no two electrons can be in the same state, including spin.
## Degenerate Matter
- Degenerate matter has unusual properties:
  1. The pressure does not depend on temperature, but only on density (increases with density)
  2. Larger mass has smaller radius/size

### Chandrasekhar limit:
- The maximum mass of degenerate object
- Maximum mass of degenerate body for white dwarf is 1.4M<sub>0</sub>
- The range of the observed radii is 0.008R<sub>0</sub> - 0.02R<sub>0</sub>
  - The radius of the earth is 0.009R<sub>0</sub>
- The range of the observed masses is 0.17M<sub>0</sub> - 1.33M<sub>0</sub>
- Most white dwarfs have masses from 0.5M<sub>0</sub> to 0.7M<sub>0</sub>
- Why are white dwarfs producing light if they do not produce energy via fusion?
- Carbon and oxygen nuclei do not obey the pauli principle: the number of nuclei in a given energy level is not limited
- Eventually all carbon and oxygen will drop to the lowest energy level and the emission of light will stop.
- The white dwarf will become a black dwarf.
- This Happens over a very long period of time, comparable to the age of the universe.
- White dwarfs have high surface temperature of several tens of thousands of degrees. As a result they emit a lot of high energy UV-photons.
- These photons excite the electrons in the atoms of planetary nebula into higher energy states.
- As they drop back into lower energy states photons are emitted. That is how planetary nebula produce light.
