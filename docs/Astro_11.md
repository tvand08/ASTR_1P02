# Chapter 11: Galaxies

## Classification of Galaxies

- Based on their appearance at visual wavelenghts:

### Elliptical Galaxies (E)

- Contain no visible gas and dust and lack hot bright stars.
- They contain mostly Population II stars and tend to be red.
- Deviation from the perfect sphere is characterized by the number.
- E0, E1, E2,..., E7
- E0 = more spherical shape | E7 = Highly Elliptical Shape
- The masses of Elliptical galaxies vary from 10% of the mass of the milky way to 100 times the mass of the milky way

### Spiral Galaxies (S)

- S<sub>0</sub> (lenticular) galaxies:
  - They have a very large nucleus and hardly visible spiral arms
- S<sub>a</sub> Galaxies:
  - These galaxies have large nuclei, less gas and dust and fewer hot luminous young stars compared to S<sub>b</sub> and S<sub>c</sub>
- S<sub>c</sub> Galaxies:
  - These galaxies have small nuclei, lots of gas and dust concentrated in spiral arms and many hot, luminous young stars located in spiral arms.
  - Appear blue in color.
- S<sub>b</sub> Galaxies:
  - Between S<sub>a</sub> according to the size of the nucleus, amount of gas and dust, and the number of hot bright stars.

- 2/3 of spiral galaxies are so called barred spiral galaxies (SB)
- They are divided into SBa, SBb and SBc according to the same criteria used for ordinary spirals.

### Irregular Galaxies (Irr)

- These Galaxies are a chaotic mix of gas and dust with no obvious nucleus and spiral arms

- Elliptical Galaxies account for about 1/3 of the galaxies we observe
- Spiral galaxies make up the majority of brighter galaxies that we observe.
- The Irregular galaxies are small and not very luminous and are harder to observe at large distances.
- Irregular galaxies may be the most common type of galaxy

## Measuring the Distance to Galaxies

- Even those athat are closest to us are distant enough that the method of stellar parallax would fail.
- (Large magellanic cloud = 170,000 ly away)
- For galaxies that are not too distant, astronomers use the method of Cepheid variables, using the period-luminosity relation for such stars.
  - This method works for distances up to 100 million ly
- For distances beyond 100 million ly use the method of Globular clusters

## Edwin Hubble

- 1929 discovered relationship between the distance of a galaxy and it recession velocity.
- Used the data on recession velocities of galaxies obtained by Vesto Slipher.
  - Slipher measured the shift of wavelengths in the spectra of galaxies and assuming that the shift results from the doppler effect he was able to deduce their speed relative to the milky way.
  - Sliphers Measurements:
    - 1913: Light from Andromeda is blueshifted
    - 1915: The spectra of 11/15 galaxies were redshifted
    - 1917: The spectra of 17/21 galaxies were redshifted
  - Except for the closer galaxies, the spectra were redshifted.
- Hubble used Slipher's data on regression velocites of galaxies and he meausre their distance using Cepheid variables.
- Hubble noticed that there is a correlation between the recession velocity and the distance:
- The current balue of Hubble's constant is `H=70 (km/s)/Mpc` where 1Mpc = 10<sup>6</sup>parsecs and 1 parsec = 3.26ly
- Hubbles law reveals that the universe is expanding
- Hubbles law: V = H*d
  - V: (Recession Velocity)
  - H: (Hubble's Constant)
  - d: (Distance of a galaxy)
- We can use hubble's law to find the distance to a galaxy.
- Hubble's law is consistent with an expanding universe
- In this expansion of space there is no single center of expansion.
- This expansion of space causes so called cosmological redshift:
  - The stretching of space causes the stretching of the wave, ie an increased wavelength(redshift)
  - The distances of the most distant galaxies in the universe are determined using type Ia supernovae (no hydrogend spectral lines)
    - They are very bright and could be observed from great distances
    - Importantly, their luminosity is always the same because they go off when the mas of a white dwarf in a binary system gets close to the Chandrasekhar limit of 1.4M<sub>0</sub> (There is always the same amount of 'explosive')
    - B = L/4(Pi d<sup>2</sup>)
      - B: Measure
      - L: Luminosity from nearby Type Ia supernovae
      - d: distance

## Distribution of Galaxies

- Occur in clusters

- Rich Galaxy Clusters

  - Contain more than 1000 Galaxies
- Poor galaxy clusters
  - Contain less than 1000 galaxies
- Collision/interaction between the galaxies is much more likely than a star-star collision
- Typical galaxy distance (I assume distance between galaxies) is about 20 times their diameters.
- Typical star-star distanceis about 10 million times the diameter of a star.
