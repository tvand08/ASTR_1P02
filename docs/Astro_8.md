# Chapter 8

## Star Formation
- To find out about the start formation we need to look at the neighbourhoods of young stars.
- H-R diagram measure luminosity(energy output) and surface temperature(spectral Class)
`O-B-A-F-G-K-M`

#### Three distinct groups of stars
1. Main Sequence (90% of all stars) main diagonal
2. White dwarfs (remnants of medium stars)
3. Red giants


- `Lifetime of a star = Fuel Available(mass)/Energy output(L) =M/L`
- For main Sequence stars L=M<sup>3.5</sup>
- The larger the mass, the shorter the Lifetime
- Younger stars are at the upper left corner of the main Sequence (Very Luminous and Very Hot) (O or B spectral class)
- Surrounded by clouds of gas (Mass = 75% H 25% He)
- When we can observe the gas we call it nebula (visible light =  400nm - 700nm)

## Nebulae
#### Reflection Nebulae
- Blue because the dust particles can scatter blue wavelengths better than longer wavelengths

#### Dark Nebulae
- The dust particles in the nebula block the light from the star behind the nebula giving them a dark appearance
- The dust particles absorb the light and the absorbed energy is reemitted as Infrared.
- You can only see dark nebulae using ir detector

#### Emission Nebulae
- Hot and Luminous young star
- Emits a lot of energy (UV)
- High energy UV Protons ionize hydrogen atmos in the nebula
- The atmosphere passes through the Red Hydrogen spectral lines giving the red color

## Giant Molecular clouds
- Stars are formed in Giant Molecular Clouds (GMC)
- Diameter ranges from 15 lightyears to 600 lightyears
- Molecular: they are dense, the dust blocks the starlight of the surrounding stars keeping the interior of the cloud cool.
- The low temperature makes it possible for hydrogen atoms to bind into the molecules H<sub>2</sub>
- The material in GMC is not distributed uniformly (Clumps of higher density)
- Why do the clumps form? Likely an explosion from a nearby supernova produces the shcok wabe which produces clumps as it passes through the GMC
- Some Dense clumps start collapsing under their own gravity and heat up in the process
- `[CLUMP] ===Gravitational Contraction===> (Protostar)`
- Protostar: a star to be
- If the clump has enough mass so that the temperature in the core of the protostar reaches __10 MILLION DEGREEES K__, the fusion of the hydrogen into helium will start and the protostar mecomes a main sequence star.
- This protostar stage is shorter for hihgher mass stars and longer for the lower mass stars.
- The protostars can be observed at infrared wavelenghts when their track on HR diagram crosses the birth line.
- Once the star reaches the main sequence stage its further evolution depends on its mass.
- If the mass of the contracting clump is less than 0.08 M<sub>0</sub> its core never gets hot enough to fuse hydrogen into helium (it doesn't reach the main sequence).
- These are called brown dwarfs or failed Stars

## Stars by mass

### Low Mass Stars
- 0.08M<sub>0</sub> <= M <= 0.5M<sub>0</sub>
  -  M<sub>0</sub> refers to solar Mass == Mass of the sun== 2*10<sup>30</sup>
- These stars fuse hydrogen into helium through __Proton-Photon Chain__
- Net result is 4 protons are fused into the nucleus of <sup>4</sup>He with release of energy.
- The mass of <sup>4</sup>He is slightly smaller than the mass of the four protons used to make it
- m=4*mass of <sup>1</sup>H - mass of <sup>4</sup>He
- Energy Released = mass*(speed of light in a vacuum)<sup>2</sup>
- E = mc<sup>2</sup>
- Because of their low mass the luminosity is low (L = M<sup>3.5</sup>)
- They are at the bottom of the main sequence (Dim and cool stars)
- They form __Red Dwarves__
  - Red: Low surface temperature
  - Dwarves: Low luminosity
- It is likely that the majority of the stars in the universe are red Dwarves, but they are hard to observe because of their low luminosity
- B = L/(4*π*d<sup>2</sup>)
  - B: Brightness
  - L: Luminosity
  - d: Distance to the star
- We cannot see Proxima Centauri despite the fact that it is the closest (4.24 ly) star to us

### Medum Mass Stars
- 0.5M<sub>0</sub> < M < 8M<sub>0</sub>
- Stars with mass < 2M<sub>0</sub> fuse hydrogen via __Proton-Proton Chain__
- Stars with mass > 2M<sub>0</sub> Fuse hydrogen through __CNO-cycle__
      - First: <sup>12</sup>C + <sup>1</sup>H ==> <sup>13</sup>N + Gamma Ray
      - Slowest Reacion: <sup>14</sup> + <sup>1</sup>H ==> <sup>15</sup>O + Gamma Ray

### High Mass Stars
- M > 8M<sub>0</sub>
- Once the star becomes a Main sequence star it is in __Hydrostatic Equilibrium__:
  - The force of gravity which is compressing the star is balanced by the outward gas pressure everywhere within the star
  - The pressure and the temperature increase with depth
- Hydrostatic Equilibrium is maintained through __Pressure-Temperature Thermostat:__
  - If the rate of the hydrogen fusion in the core goes up, the pressure and the temperature will increase
  - increased pressure pushes out the top layers and the star expands and cools.
  - The reaction rate reduces
- However, the luminosity of main sequence stars increases slowly over time (The present Luminosity of the Sun L<sub>0</sub>= 4*10<sup>26</sup> Watts is 30% higher than what it was when it became a main sequence star some 4.6 billion years ago).
- Why does the luminosity increase over time?
- `p=n·T`
- pressure = (particle numer density)·(Temperature)
- To maintian the same pressure (P) in order to support the top layers with decreasing n the temperature t has to increase over time.
- As t increases the rate of fusion reaction increases, producing more energy per unit of time (ie L increases)
- in 0.5-1 billion years the luminosity of the sun would be high enough that all water on earth would evaporate.

## The Final stages in the life of a Sun-Like star
- Eventually all of the hydrogen in the core is fused into (4.5 - 5 billion years)
- The mass of the sun is not high enough to ignite He-core.
- He-core contracts under its gravity and heats up
