# Chapter 10: The Milky Way Galaxy

## Introduction
- Appears as a diffuse band of light across the sky
- In 1609 Galileo observed that it consist of very many faint stars- faint because they are at a great distance.
- In the 18th century it was proposed by __Thomas Wright__ and by __Immanuel Kant__ that we observe it because we live in a disk of stars

## Globular clusters
- __Harlow Shapley__ established our location in the milky way after WWI by measuring the distances to globular clusters in the Galaxy
- They contain from 100,000 to 1,000,000 stars and are therefore very bright and easy to see from large distances.
- He used the method of Cepheid variables proposed by __Henrietta Swan Leavitt__ in 1912.
- Cepheid variables are pulsating yellow giant stars.
Stefan-Boltzmann law: L=C*R<sup>2</sup>T<sup>4</sup>
  - R: radius
  - T: Temperature
- Leavitt found the Period-Luminosity relation by observing cepheids in the small magellanic Galaxy:

## Measurements
- More than half of all globular clusters are found in the direction of sagitarius
- He argued that they must be distributed around the galactic center as a result of gravitational pull.
- Hence our solar system must be some distance away from the galactic centre
- Diamater of the milky way disk= 100,000 ly
- Distance between sun and galactic center = 30,000 ly
- Thickness of disk between 1,000 ly and 3,000 ly

## Contents of the Milky way
- Disk contains: stars, star clusters, gas and dust
- Star clusters:
  - Associations:
    - Clusters of 10-100 young, hot (O | B Class) Luminous sagitarius
  - Open Clusters:
    - Clusters of 100-1000 stars, also hot and luminous
- Halo: Stars (cooler lower main sequence stars), globular clusters __NO__ Gas or dust
- Bulge: Stars are similar to those in the halo but also contains some hot and luminous stars
- The material in the disk is not distributed uniformly but is concentrated in spiral arms
- How do we know that since the gas and the dust block our view?
- When we look at other spiral galaxies we observe that their spiral arms are outlined by the assocations and open clusters of hot Luminous Stars.
- therefore we should look for such clusters of hot and luminous stars in the milky way.
- Gas and dust are also concentrated in spiral arms
- The disk stars differ from those in the halo and the bulge by their content of elements heavier than He
- Disk Stars: __Population I Stars__, which have higher content of metals (2-3%)
- Halo and Bulge: __Population II stars__, which have a lower concentration of metals(0.1%)

## Motions of stars in the Milky way
- Disk: Stars move in circular, slightly undulated, orbits in the same direction. The sun moves at a speed of about 220 km/s around the galactic center and it takes 230 million years to complete one revolution at a distance of about 30,000 ly.
- Sun has (Supposedly) completed 20 revolutions
- Halo: Stars move along highly elliptical orbits randomly oriented and with no overall directino of motion.
Bulge: the motions of stars are similar to those in the halo.
- one can use the orbital data of stars in th galaxy to determine the mass of a galaxy using the third keplers law as formulated by __Newton__
- The rotation curves of stars in the galaxies are very different.
- They were first measured by __Vera Rubin__ in 1970s
- However the Observed rotation did not match the Keplerian rotation curve.
- If one assumes that the Newton's Laws are working at these large distances, there must be additional mass that we cannot see

## Dark Matter
- There is mass in the galaxy which does not emit light- Dark Matter.
- It is distributed throughout galactic halo and its mass is about 5 times the mass of luminous Matter.
- The notion of dark matter was introduced in 1933 by Fritz Zwicky
- He observed the motions of galaxies in a cluster of galaxies called __Coma Cluster__:
- The Galaxies in the cluster are bound by the force of gravitational attraction.
- Luminous mass was only 1/400 of the total mass needed to explain the orbital speeds of galaxies in the cluster.
- What is dark matter?
- MACHO(Massice astrophysical compact halo objects): Black Holes, Neutron stars, old white dwarfs, brown dwarfs.
How
- Calculations == > reuslt: the MACHO Can account for at mose 19% of the total mass of dark matter.
- __Composition of the Universe:__
  - 5% ordinary Matter
  - 27% dark Matter
  - 68% dark energy

## Spiral arms of the Milky way
- They are the waves of compression of the material in the disk and they move around more slowly than the individual stars.
- Cloud of gas and dust enters the arm and gets compressed (star formation is triggered)
- Hot and luminous stars do not live long and spend lifetime in the arm.
- lower mass stars live longer and contine trip out of arm
- The Center of the milky way is in the direction of constellation sagitarius.
- Galactic center is only observable at x-ray and radia wavelenghts
- At the very center is Sagitarrius A and at tis core is a very intense source of radio waves known as SGRA*
- Using the third kepler's law astronomers have determined the mass of the central object to be 4 Million M<sub>0</sub>
- Something that massive can only be a black hole.
- It is found that other galaxies also have supermassive black holes at their centers
