# Chapter 9: Stellar Remnants

## Remnants of a Medium Mass Star
- __Planetary Nebula:__ spherical shell of the star's material pushed out by the thermal and radiation pressure during the final red giant stage.
- White dwarf in center of __Planetary Nebula__ is "dead"(non fusing) core composed of <sup>12</sup>C and some <sup>16</sup>O.
- Examples of planetary nebulae:
  - Helix nebula
  - Ring nebula
- Seen as a ring instead of spherical shell.
- Their name (planetary) comes from the fact that when viewed through a small telescope they appear as blue-green, just like the planets uranus and neptune.
- But they have nothing to do with planets or planet formation

## White dwarfs
- Examples of white dwarfs:
  - Sirus b
- White dwarfs are very dense:
  - Density= 1000kg/m<sup>3</sup>
- Why doesn't it collapse under it's own gravity (it stopped generating energy via fusion)?
- It is supported by __Electron Degeneracy Pressure:__
  - Positively charged <sup>12</sup>C and some <sup>16</sup>O nuclei densly packed
  - Negative electrions which are in __Degenerate State__
- Quantam Mechangics: Electrons obey __Pauli Principle__- no two electrons can be in the same state, including spin.

## Degenerate Matter
- Degenerate matter has unusual properties:
  1. The pressure does not depend on temperature, but only on density (increases with density)
  2. Larger mass has smaller radius/size

## Chandrasekhar limit:
- The maximum mass of degenerate object
- Maximum mass of degenerate body for white dwarf is 1.4M<sub>0</sub>
- The range of the observed radii is 0.008R<sub>0</sub> - 0.02R<sub>0</sub>
  - The radius of the earth is 0.009R<sub>0</sub>
- The range of the observed masses is 0.17M<sub>0</sub> - 1.33M<sub>0</sub>
- Most white dwarfs have masses from 0.5M<sub>0</sub> to 0.7M<sub>0</sub>
- Why are white dwarfs producing light if they do not produce energy via fusion?
- Carbon and oxygen nuclei do not obey the pauli principle: the number of nuclei in a given energy level is not limited
- Eventually all carbon and oxygen will drop to the lowest energy level and the emission of light will stop.
- The white dwarf will become a black dwarf.
- This Happens over a very long period of time, comparable to the age of the universe.
- White dwarfs have high surface temperature of several tens of thousands of degrees. As a result they emit a lot of high energy UV-photons.
- These photons excite the electrons in the atoms of planetary nebula into higher energy states.
- As they drop back into lower energy states photons are emitted. That is how planetary nebula produce light.

## The life story of a high mass star
- Because of the high mass all stages last shorter period of time.
- Protostar stage, main sequence lifetime...
- The star contracts quickly because of the high mass
- Because of very high mass the helium core is compressed and heated right away and fusion of <sup>4</sup>He into <sup>12</sup>C and <sup>16</sup> proceeds without a pause (no first red giant stage).
- nucleosynthesis: fusion of heavier nuclei from the lighter ones.

## Type Ia Supernova:
- strong gravity near a dense with dwarf attracts some of the material from companion stars and the mass of the white dwarf increases.
- it compresses and heats up. Once its mass gets close to the __Chandrasekhar Limit__, the temperature is so high that there are runaway fusion reactions. So much energy is release that the entire system is disrupted in a gigantic explosion (Type Ia supernova).
- Because of their high luminosity, they are easy to see at very large distances.
- Since they all occur via the same mechanism  and we know how much explosive there is (Chandrasevchar Limiting mass) They all have the same luminosity L.
- B=L/(4路PI路d<sup>2</sup>)
- To find their distance d. This method is used to find the distances of the most distant galaxies.

## Type II supernova
- Each fusion reaction releases less energy than the previous one and the rate at which the nuclear fuel is used increases with the mass of the nuclei that make up the fuel.
- In all fusion reactions the energy is release(exothermic)
- To fuse nuclei heavier than iron the energy must be supplied(endo thermic)
- This is because the binding energy for per nucleon is the highest for iron.
- Therefore, once the iron core is formed there are no further fusion reactions in the iron core.
- what prevents Gravitational collapse of a very dense iron core is the electron degeneracy pressure.
- The mass of the iron core increases as more and more iron is produced in the Si-fusing shell. Eventually the Chandrasekhar limit is reached for degenerate iron core and it collapses in a millisecond as electrons combine with protons to form neutrons and neutrinos.

### Neutron Star
- their density is the same as the density of atomic nucleus (10<sup>11</sup>kg/cm<sup>3</sup>). Neutrons also obey the Pauli principle and it is the degeneracy pressure of neutrons that prevents the gravitational collapse of a neutron star.
- Just after it was formed the neutron core is squeezed tightly and then it rebounds. The infalling material from the edge of the iron core and surrounding shells runs into the rebounding core.
- As a result the shock wave is created - it moves out and starts to rip the star apart. It stalls as the energy of the shock wave is absorbed by the top layers.
- When it formed the neutron core is very hot (temperature =  100 billion k)
- at these high temps a large number of energetic thermal neutrinos is produced and their push continues the work of the shock wave and the star blows up in __Type II__ Supernova.
- Most of the energy released in type II supernova is carried away by neutrinos. only 0.1% of the release energy is carried by visible light.

- What is left after typ II supernova?
  1. Supernova Remnant
    - expanding and glowing gas effected by the explosion
  2. Neutron Star Or Black Hole
    - Neutron star if mass of collapsed core < 3M<sub>0</sub>
    - Black hole if mass of the collapsed core > 3M<sub>0</sub>
- What is the observational evidence for the neutron stars?
  - Observation of pulsars which are fast spinning neutron stars.
  - Electric charges pulled from the surface of neutron star spiral around magnetic field lines and as a result produce highly directional electromagnetic radiation.
  - If the beam happens to point toward the earth we detect a puls of radiation.
  - First observed in 1967 by Jocelyn Bell
- Why is the spin of a neutron star fast?
  - __Conservation of angular momentum__
    - ie. the closer the center of mass to the middle the faster the spin
    - Angular momentum = MRV
    - = Mass*Average distance from rotational axis * rotational speed
  - The spin rate of a neutron star decreases over time as it loses the rotational energy via radiation

## Black Holes
- If the mass of the collapsed core is > 3M<sub>0</sub> the degeneracy pressure of neutrons cannot support it and it collapses into a single point - a singularity in spacetime.
- The resulting object is called a black hole.
- Escape Velocity
  - v<sub>esc</sub><sup>2</sup> = GM/R
    - G: Gravitational constant
    - M: Given Mass
    - R: Given Radius
- If v<sub>esc</sub><sup>2</sup> > C(300,000 km/s), then nothing, including light, can escape the gravity of the body.
- __Schwarzschild Radius__ R<sub>s</sub>:
  - A distance from the body within which the escape velocity is greater than the speed of light.
  - R<sub>s</sub> = 3M
    - M in terms of M<sub>0</sub>
- What is the observational evidence for black holes?
  - Look for a binary system (two entities) of a normal star and an invisible companion with a mass of at least 3M<sub>0</sub> which is a strong source of x-rays
  - First observatio made by tom bolton in 1971 using 1.9nm reflector telescope at the david dunlop observatory.
  - The normal star was Cygnus and the black hole was named cygnusXI.
- To describe vicinity of blcck holes we need Einstein's General Theory of Relativity(1915):
  - Mass or Energy bends space and other object move in that space along paths of shortest distance(geodesics)

## Gravitational Redshift
- As a photon escapes the gravitational pull by mass M it loses energy and the wavelength of light increases:
  - Photon Energy= Constant/位
    - 位= wavelength
- The Gravitational redshift is different from the one caused by the doppler effect when the source is moving away from the observer
