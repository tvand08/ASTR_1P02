# Chapter 13: Solar System

## The Inventory of the Solar System
   1. The Sun
      - Largest object in the solar system
      - About 99.9% of the total mass of the solar system is in the sun
      - The diameter of the sun is 109 times the diameter of the earth, or about 10 times the diameter of Jupiter
    2. 8 Planets moving in nearly circular orbits around the Sun and several dwarf planets

        | Planet  | Type        | Distance from Sun| Known Satellites | Rings |
        |---------|:-----------:|:----------------:|:----------------:|:-----:|
        | Mercury | Terrestrial | 0.4 AU           | None             | NO    |
        | Venus   | Terrestrial | 0.7 AU           | None             | NO    |  
        | Earth   | Terrestrial | 1 AU             | 1 ( The Moon)    | NO    | 
        | Mars    |Terrestrial  | 1.5 AU           | 2                | NO    |
        | Jupiter | Jovian      | 5 AU             | 63+              | YES   |
        | Saturn  | Jovian      | 10 AU            | 61+              | YES   |
        | Uranus  | Jovian      | 20 AU            | 27+              | YES   |
        | Neptune | Jovian      | 30 AU            | 13+              | YES   |

        - Dwarf Planets:
            - Pluto
            - Eris
        - The discovery of Eris in 2005 prompted the International Astronomical Union to come up with the following criteria for a body in the solar system to be classified as a planet:
            1. It has to revolve around the sun:
            2. It has to be massive enough to asssume approximately spherical shape under its own gravity
            3. It is the only body of that size at that distance from the sun (i.e. it has cleared its orbit)
        - Pluto fails criterion 3
    3. Satellites and rings
        - Shown in table above

    4. Asteroids
        - Appolo Asteroids
        - Trojan Asteroids
    5. Comets
        - Chunks of frozen gases with solid particles mixed in
        - Hale-Bopp 1997
    6. Meteors
        - Meteoroids:
            - Small Solid objects
        - Meteors
            - "Shooting Stars"
        - Meteorites
            - Finds on Earth
    7. Interplanetary Medium
        - Gas and dust

## Regularities in planetary motions:
1. First Kepler's Law
    - Planets move along elliptical orbits with Sun at one focus
    - Eccentricity is the measure of how elliptical the orbits are
    - The eccentricities of planetary orbits are less than 10 % (Except for mercury e = 0.206 ~= 21%)
   
    |Orbiting Body| Eccentricity|
    |:-:|:-:|
    |Mercury|e=0.206|
    |Venus|e=0.007|
    |Earth|e=0.017|
    |Mars|e=0.093|
    |Icarus|e=0.83|
    |Halley|e=0.968|
    
    - **Icarus** is an Apollo asteroid while **Halley** is a comet
2. The orbits of all planets are nearly in the plane of the ecliptic (the orbital plane of the earth)
    - the inclination angles of all planetary orbits are less than 10<sup>o</sup>
